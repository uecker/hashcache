This is a tiny tool for Linux which computes a sha256 hash of 
a file and stores it in an extended attribute. It can be used
to verify file integrity, find duplicates, detect changes, etc.

(Note that it is not intended to detect malicious changes to
a file, because an attacker who has access to the file could
also change the cached hash.)
